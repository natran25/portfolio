            <h1>Lacrosse</h1>
            <p>I played lacrosse for 8 years prior to coming to college. I began playing in the fifth grade and played all throughout
            high school. I enjoyed playing the sport because it was fast-paced, physical and exciting. I am still involved with the
            sport as a youth coach in my hometown and I like playing sport with my friends in my freetime.</p>

            <h1> Filipino American Student Association</h1>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, the organization that I am most involved in is the Filipino American Student Association,
            or FASA. This is the Filipino student organization on campus that hosts different types of events like cultural and
            professional development workshops and dance performances. FASA works to promote and communicate Filipino culture as
            well as create a welcoming space for all members. FASA is where I met several of my friends and will no doubt be one of
            the most memorable parts of my college experience.</p>
