        <p>At home, I live with my two younger brothers, my parents, and my dog. My youngest brother is named Tyler and he is in
        the eighth grade. My middle brother is named Caden and he is currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at
        Urbana-Champaign. My mom is named Theresa and my dad is named Vince, and a fun fact about them is that they have the
        exact same birthday! My dog, Kobe, is a golden doodle and he is 5 years old. </p>

        <p>I have a big group of friends from high school. We became close friends after winning our high schoolâ€™s annual Senior
        Lip Sync contest that we entered as a group. For fun, we like to get smoothies, watch sports, and play videogames
        together like NBA 2K. We now go to universities all across the country, so when we get together over breaks, it is
        always a fun time. </p>

        <p>At Michigan, I have met most of my friends through the student orgs that I have joined. When we hang out, we like to
        watch movies or YouTube videos, get food around Ann Arbor, study together, and listen to music. I am glad to have met these people and I
        hope they become my lifelong friends. </p>
